### What were some challenges you faced while making this app?

Some challenges we faced were how to start this project. Our team had a hard time connecting the frontend to the backend with the REST API. However once we started watching this Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngc9gnGgUdA, we started to understand the connection between the frontend/backend and the database. 
Other challenges we faced were linking the CreatePost page to the Post page once the new post was added. 

### Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make

One additional feature we wanted to add if we had more time was the Google Authentication in addition to what we have now. It would be nice to allow the users to sign in with their Google accounts and make our app safer. 

Another feature that would be beneficial to the users would be onboarding slides to teach our users how to use our website. 


### What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?

This project was pretty straightforward, however one assumption we made was that our comments were an attribute to a post instead of being broken apart. This helped us in many ways such as deleting a post which would delete all the comments.



### How long did this assignment take to complete?


This assignment took our group about 2 weeks of meeting 3 hours everyday.  We were really hoping to finish early since we have WiT Regatta conference this week and next!
